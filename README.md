✅ GitHub README Description:

🎬 Movie Genre Prediction using NLP + Machine Learning

This project uses text descriptions of movies to classify them into genres using machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

📌 Features:

Dataset: 55,000+ movie records

Text Vectorization using:

TfidfVectorizer

CountVectorizer (Bag of Words)


Genre Encoding using LabelEncoder

Models used:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Bernoulli Naive Bayes


Accuracy evaluation using train-test split


🛠 Tech Stack:

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

TfidfVectorizer / CountVectorizer



🔍 Key Learnings:

Feature extraction from raw text

Model comparison for multi-class classification

Clean handling of non-numeric errors (ValueError)

Hands-on with Bag of Words vs TF-IDF

📁 Output:

Genre classification predictions

Clean TF-IDF features

Model accuracy reports
